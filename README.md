  <h2>Background Information</h2>
  <h3>Respiration</h3>
  <p>Respiration is the process of organisms combining oxygen and glucose molecules to create energy and generate CO2 in the mitochondria. Fungal respiration creates byproducts, both useful and harmful to organisms, such as lactic acid or alcohol during the process called fermentation which generates molecules that the bacterial mitochondria such as the one of yeast can turn into ATP. Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen used by organisms to generate energy.</p>

  <h3>ATP</h3>
  <p>ATP is adenosine triphosphate, which is the source of energy for use and storage at the cellular level. ATP is used in many reactions in an organism. ATP releases energy as a phosphate(PO43-) molecule is detached, turning it into ADP(adenosine diphosphate). ADP molecules can then be turned into ATP molecules through respiration and then the cycle can repeat.</p>

  <h3>Carbohydrate</h3>
  <p>Carbohydrates can be split into four types, monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides have to be broken down into monosaccharides. Fructose and galactose have to be converted into glucose before being turned into ATP(Adenosine Triphosphate), energy-carrying molecules.</p>

  <h3>Yeast</h3>
  <p>Yeast has about 500 different species. Yeast transforms carbohydrates into alcohol and CO2 to create ATP, energy-carrying molecules. However, yeast is sometimes used for scientific use. Yeast is widely used in biology experiments because it is easy to grow, and manipulate and can yield results very quickly. This makes yeast a very good choice for many biological experiments as yeast gives results quickly, is very reliable, and is not bound by animal ethics guidelines as yeast is a type of fungi that allows wing experiments that include deprivation of nutrients.</p>

  <h2>Question Hypothesis Variables</h2>
  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
  <p>How does the type of carbohydrate affect the rate of respiration, measured by CO2 production of yeast?</p>

  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
  <p>Glucose will generate the most CO2. dextrose will be the next most, sucrose, fructose, maltose.</p>

  <p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Independent Variables</strong></p>
  <p>Type of the carbohydrate (Glucose, fructose, sucrose, dextrose, and maltose)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Dependent Variables</strong></p>
  <p>We will measure the amount of CO2 produced in cm³ by making the gas go through the delivery tube into the gas cylinder</p>

<section id="method">
  <h2>Method/Process</h2>
  <h3>Method:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up the equipment: conical flask in a water bath and a bung connected to a gas cylinder.</li>
    <li>Put 100 ml water, 5 g of carbohydrate.</li>
    <li>Put 3g of yeast into the bottle.</li>
    <li>Put the bung on quickly.</li>
    <li>Wait for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Check the gas cylinder reading and record it.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2-4 for all the types of carbohydrates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Process:</h3>
  <h4>First:</h4>
  <p>At first, we used cold distilled water, which resulted in the yeast not activating properly due to the low temperature.</p>

  <h4>Second:</h4>
  <p>We then modified the method by mixing boiling water and cold water to create water at approximately 35°C. However, the water cooled too quickly before the yeast could activate, which again led to unsuccessful results.</p>

  <h4>Final:</h4>
  <p>To address this, we revised the method a third time by using a water bath to maintain the water temperature at a consistent 35°C. This successfully activated the yeast, and the method worked effectively.</p>

  <h2>Result/Equipments</h2>
  <h3>Result</h3>
  <p>The results of the experiment will be shown after we complete our tests and measure how much CO2 gas was produced with each sugar.</p>
  <p>The measurements will be recorded in a table format for comparison.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Our hypothesis was that glucose will generate the most CO2. Dextrose will be the next most, sucrose, fructose, maltose. However the actual results were that dextrose generated the most then fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose. This could have been due to the amount that was well dissolved or how fine the powder was. Glucose for example had a few solid chunks and fructose also had some. Dextrose was a sticky syrup type. These differences could have changed the absorption/metabolism rate which may have caused some uncertainties. In general monosaccharides created most gas. This may be because the monosaccharides are the simplest to metabolise and disaccharides such as sucrose needed to be broken down into monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose which took up time.</p>
